Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.

Normalizing styles have been helped along thanks to the fine work of
Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/

Some inspiration has been drawn from Underscores http://underscores.me/, (C) 2012-2015 Automattic, Inc.

Creating a site has never been easier either thanks to the fine work by Zurb,
who created Foundation which this theme is based on.

The stylesheet file is used as a placeholder to keep WordPress happy.
All styles are written in SASS (see assets/sass directory) and saved and minified in the assets/css folder.
Styles are included via core/functions/scripts-styles.php
